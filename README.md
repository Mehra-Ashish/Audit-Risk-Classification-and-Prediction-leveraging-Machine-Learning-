# Audit-Risk-Classification-and-Prediction-leveraging-Machine-Learning-In Python
Our main objective is divided in to two parts:  
1. Predict Audit Risk, i.e to build a model that accurately predicts the audit risk parameter before the audit team engages into the audit to provide an insight and prepare a robust audit plan    
2. Classify high risk and fradulent firms, we need to build a model that based on past and current measures of risk and other parameters helps the audit team to indentify high risk and fraudulent firms   
In terms of machine learning to obtain the above objectives we have classified the problem into following parts:  
1.Regression Problem: To build a prediction model to predict Audit Risk 
2.Classification Problem: To identify or classify different firms into risky or non-risky categories

Data of 777 different firms are collected from six distinct sectors. In recent years, machine learning has developed and received major attention in the predictive analytics in audit research. The main objective is to produce an efficient and effective prediction model, that will be hybrid of various machine learning algorithmic characteristics, which will be capable of predicting whether any fraud has been committed in any firm or not.
